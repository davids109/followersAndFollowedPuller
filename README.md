# followers-followed 
hi! this is a code i put together to show my skills on upwork. it logs in on insta with some credentials and pulls the followers or the followed accounts of a specific accounts. 
when it will run (which by the way you do from the console, writing `python3 followers&followed` in the console, having python3 installed), it will ask you to provide some data. 
it does need `selenium webdriver` and `beautifulsoup4` tu run, so make sure to have pip installed. 
if you git (or download) the code, it will come with a `geckodrive executable`, that is fundamental for the working of the program. it will also come with an empty `data.json`, which will be populated by the data once you run the code correctly.
