# Followers And Followed Instagram Puller 
hi!
this program logs in on Instagram with some credentials and pulls the followers or the followed accounts of a specific accounts.  
when it will run (which by the way you do from the console, writing `python3 FollowersAndFollowedPuller` in the console, having python3 installed), it will ask you to provide some data.  
it does need `selenium webdriver` and `beautifulsoup4` tu run, so make sure to have them pip installed.  
if you git (or download) the code, it will come with a `geckodrive executable`, that is fundamental for the working of the program. it will also come with an empty `data.json`, which will be populated by the data once you run the code correctly.  
I do not take responsability if Instagram decides to action ban or to suspend your account.
